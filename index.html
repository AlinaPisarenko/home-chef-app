            very exciting and special task. Cooking a surprise meal can increase
            your motivation to roll up your sleeves in the kitchen and cook one
            of your best meals to date. Whether it be for your partner, family
            or friends, it will surely make them feel appreciated and you never
            know, they may just return the favour.

            Playing your favourite songs whilst cooking creates a fun and
            energetic ambience in the kitchen. Lets face it, sometimes cooking

            that play button! (Personal tip: connect your phone or laptop to a
            speaker, so you can recreate the best cooking fiesta in your
            kitchen)
